### Base URL

The Bleeprs API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS for every request to improve data security, initegrity and privacy. The API does not support HTTP requests.

All request should be sent to the following base URL:

```
https://api.bleeprs.com
```

### Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you must add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer {token} where {token} is your API key.

```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Response codes

Bleeprs uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

In general, `2XX` HTTP codes mean your request was successful, `4XX` codes are for user-related failures, and `5XX` codes are for internal server issues.

### Response Codes

| Status | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Succesful Request                      |
| `400`  | Check is the parameters were correct   |
| `401`  | The API key is missing or incorrect    |
| `403`  | A process was rejected                 |
| `404`  | A resource was not found               |
| `429`  | The rate limit was exceeded            |
| `5XX`  | Internal server error, contact support |

### Rate limits

The maximum number of API requests that users can send is **20 per second**. The headers below will be sent with every response in accordance with the IETF standard:

| Header name             | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Maximum number of requests allowed within a window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | How many requests you have left within the window.  |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The timestamp at which the rate limit will reset.   |

When the limit is reached, you will receive a `429` HTTP error code.

To prevent this, we recommend reducing the rate at which you send requests. This can be done by introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second. If you have specific requirements, **contact support** to request a rate increase.
