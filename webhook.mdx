In addition to email notification of transactions, webhook is a fast and cost-effective way to manage system-to-system communications. Below are the supported events that trigger a webhook on Bleeprs.

### Authentication

When you create a webhook URL on your dashboard, the system will generate a unique secret token. This token will be sent as a `X-Webhook-Token` header with each request. You should verify the token to ensure that the request is coming from Bleeprs.

### Events

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Processing">
    ðŸ“£ `event.processing` Is the first event you recieve for any message sent.

```json
{
  "event": "event.processing",
  "data": {
    "id": 23,
    "messageReference": "BLPRS_MG_****",
    "completed": false,
    "amount": "0.5",
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

### Configure Webhook

To get webhook events and actions notifications, you are required to provide a webhook URL which these notifications will be sent. Follow the steps below to setup a webhook on your Pooler account:

Go to **profile/setting** and update the Webhook hook url

<Info>
  Webhooks are very important for notifying you about the status of your
  delivery
</Info>

### Retry policy

If our attempt to deliver the POST request to your webhook URL fails with an HTTP response that is not `2XX`, we will retry the request up to **6 times** with a **60 second** delay between each attempt. With each subsequent failure, the wait time will double. If after all attempts the webhook is still not acknowledged, no further attempts will be made.
