## Security

This section will guide you through accessing your Bleeprs resources, and the available security operations. Here you will learn how authentication, and user verification, work on Bleeprs.

When you sign up, Pooler creates API keys for you to use when making and verifying requests. You can find these keys on your dashboard. There are two types of API keys on Pooler:

### Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Public Keys">
    This key exists today but has been disbaled on the system globally. This key
    serves as a way to authenticate public communications on your Bleeprs
    account from third-party systems without any security risk. This key starts
    with `pk_******`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Private Keys">
    This key is your primary security key used for access your account via api
    for all possible resource communications you find on this guide. The key
    starts with `sk_***`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
